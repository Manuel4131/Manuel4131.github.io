=== Git.io page===
The webpage shown on github.io can be very simple. 
It only has to point out the major works and most important
information for welcoming people to know more about me.
It looks like a CV. It shouldn't contain some works like
technichal translation or some programming experience posts.
But if you have these information and the "real" personal blog
is not completed yet, to post these on git.io could help me
to promote yourself in the human market. 

"Use the medium power to promote yourself"
(Reference _CA_, mosky, T.P., Micheal, Andy and you'll know.)


=== Django personal Blog=== 

The real personal website should be implemented by backend
framework and related skills and the source is open. 


Reference _CA_ about.me:

https://about.me/legnaleurc

The interface looks not good... But he put many importan factors there.
Well, a personal customzied blog is really required at all.
